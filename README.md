# arrow-dataset-manipulation
This repo contains old and refactored versions of code for manipulation of Arrow datasets.

Notes on the refactored code:
1- No for loops are being used to process the data anymore which noticeably improves the runtime 
2- Replaced hard-coded variables in the code's logic with variables.
