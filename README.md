# arrow-dataset-manipulation
This repo contains old and refactored versions of code for manipulation of Arrow datasets.

Notes on the refactored code:
1. No for loops are being used to process the data anymore which noticeably improves the runtime 
2. Replaced hard-coded variables in the code's logic with variables.
3. There was no obvious pattern in how the data was being manipulated in the provided code, which is why the variable names are not very expressive at times in the refactored code. Usually that would depend on the application at hand.




⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
